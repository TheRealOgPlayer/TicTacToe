# TicTacToe
This is a fun little project I did to get better at C# 
It is TicTacToe so enjoy

# Difficulties 

- Easy:
Can be selcted by typing `E` or `e` on app startup, This mode lets the user go first and makes all of the bots movments random. 

- Medium:
Can be selcted by typing `M` or `m` on app startup, This mode has the logic of hard mode but does not block the user from the Hard Movement found in the Movement.txt file

- Hard:
Can be selcted by typing `H` or `h` on app startup, This mode has the bot go first and is very hard to beat but possible.

- Impossible
Can be selcted by typing `I` or `i` on app startup, This mode has the bot go first and is impossible to beat as far as I know.

- Debugging Mode:
Can be selcted by typing `D` or `d` on app startup, This is not a gamemode but instead a setting that makes it so the console will not clear and you will get a lot of debug info. Could be useful if you want to add on or make your own TicTacToe and need to understand how my code works better.

- Exit:
Can be selcted by typing `9` on app startup, This is not a gamemode but instead a setting that simply exits the program. 

# Other
There is not much more to say I know I could have made this better but I still think it is cool how it works. I do plan on making another version of this but I do not know when that will be out. I will put it on this github as a Version2. 

# Versions
> The most up to date version is Version 1.3

## Version 1.3:
> This version came out 12/11/2023
> Made impossible mode even more impossible. I found out how to win in impossible mode which you no longer can do or at least I don't think you can.
> The new checks impossible mode makes can be found in the `Version1.3/NewChecks.txt` file.

## Version 1.2:
This version came out 12/04/2023
Fixed a bug that caused multiple instances of the application to open. This happend when you pressed and held the enter key once the application first starts. This causes the program to crash and for the EXE to be launched again and again because you are holding enter.
Debugging mode now tells the user their error codes if a `try statement` is called.
