# TicTacToe
This is a fun little project I did to get better at C# 
It is TicTacToe so enjoy

# Difficulties 

- Easy:
Can be selcted by typing `E` or `e` on app startup, This mode lets the user go first and makes all of the bots movments random. 

- Medium:
Can be selcted by typing `M` or `m` on app startup, This mode has the logic of hard mode but does not block the user from the Hard Movement found in the Movement.txt file

- Hard:
Can be selcted by typing `H` or `h` on app startup, This mode has the bot go first and is impossible to beat. 

- Debugging Mode:
Can be selcted by typing `D` or `d` on app startup, This is not a gamemode but instead a setting that makes it so the console will not clear and you will get a lot of debug info. Could be useful if you want to add on or make your own TicTacToe and need to understand how my code works better.

- Exit:
Can be selcted by typing `9` on app startup, This is not a gamemode but instead a setting that simply exits the program. 

# Other
There is not much more to say I know I could have made this better but I still think it is cool how it works. I do plan on making another version of this but I do not know when that will be out. I will put it on this github as a Version2.
